        "**What is Python?** Python is a general purpose programming language. This stands in contrast to the statistical packages such as R, Stata, SAS, and SPSS you may be familiar with. On one hand, this is a fantastic thing because it affords researchers with a good amount of flexibility. For instance, this theoretically enables us to collect, clean, explore, visualize, analyze and report our data all in one tool rather than splitting this up among many tools. On the other hand, with a broader package of capabilities comes more to learn. Fortunately, Python is a very 'high level' language, which for us means it's pretty easy to learn and you can do a lot with a fairly limited amount of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is an *interpreted language*. This means that you *generally* need to have Python installed on your computer in order to run Python programs (Python programs typically are files that end in '.py'). The basic Python interpreter can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/. However, for newcomers to Python, I recommend getting Anaconda, which bundles together Python with a bunch of functionality extensions (called *packages*) that are commonly used in data analysis. Anaconda can be obtained at https://www.anaconda.com/.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a way that you can use Python *without* downloading anything: **Google Colaboratory**. Google Colaboratory (found at https://colab.research.google.com/) is an online tool where you can run Python programs on Google's computers for free. You do have to be online to use them, you have to have a Google account, and you're at Google's mercy when doing so... so if you are running something *too* data intensive, Google may shut you down. However, unless your program is running for hours on end (e.g., training deep neural networks sometimes does this) or you leave it idle for a long time, I've never had any problems.\n",
