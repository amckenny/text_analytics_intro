# Introduction to Text Analytics with Python
---

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python code to accompany workshops/classes that I give on the use of text analytics in management and entrepreneurship research. Modules 1-3 are designed to be self-led explorations into the basics of Python to provide workshop participants with a baseline familiarity of Python before entering the workshop/class. Modules 4 and on are designed to be used during the workshops/classes themselves and so have less *discussion/explicit explanation* in them. This being said, I believe that with some tinkering, even these modules can be explored outside of a workshop context.
